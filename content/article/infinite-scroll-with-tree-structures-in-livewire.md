title: Infinite Scroll with Tree Structures in Livewire
---

## The Challenge

Recently at work, we faced a challenge with implementing pagination on a database table that had a self reference,
creating a tree structure. The requirement was to show the tree in depth first order, paginate the results with
an infinite scroll so the parent child relationships could easily be visualized, and allow inserts at any level of
the tree, rendering the new nodes efficiently.

## Understanding Tree Structures in Databases

### Self-Referencing Tables

- Basic concept of parent_id foreign key pointing to the same table
- Challenges with traditional pagination approaches
- Why depth-first ordering matters for user experience

### Depth-First Traversal Fundamentals

- How depth-first search works in tree structures
- Converting recursive tree traversal to flat, paginated results
- Maintaining hierarchical context in a linear view

## The Pagination Problem

### Traditional Pagination Limitations

- Why LIMIT/OFFSET fails with tree structures
- Performance issues with deep hierarchies
- Loss of context when jumping between pages

### Cursor-Based Pagination for Trees

- Designing effective cursor strategies for hierarchical data
- Encoding tree position in pagination cursors
- Handling edge cases (deleted nodes, reordering)

## Livewire Implementation Strategy

### Component Architecture

- Designing the main tree component structure
- Managing state for infinite scroll
- Handling nested component relationships

### Database Query Optimization

- Using recursive CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Efficient depth-first ordering queries
- Indexing strategies for performance

### Frontend Considerations

- Managing scroll position and loading states
- Rendering tree indentation and visual hierarchy
- Handling dynamic content height changes

## Building the Solution

### Step 1: Database Schema and Queries

- Table structure for self-referencing data
- Recursive CTE implementation for depth-first ordering
- Cursor-based pagination query logic

### Step 2: Livewire Component Development

- Creating the main tree component
- Implementing infinite scroll triggers
- Managing loading states and user feedback

### Step 3: Tree Rendering Logic

- Displaying hierarchical indentation
- Maintaining visual parent-child relationships
- Optimizing DOM updates for performance

## Handling Dynamic Insertions

### Real-Time Updates

- Inserting new nodes at arbitrary tree positions
- Maintaining sort order after insertions
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

### State Management Challenges

- Keeping track of expanded/collapsed states
- Handling cursor invalidation after insertions
- Synchronizing multiple user sessions

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Level

- Query optimization techniques
- Proper indexing for tree traversal
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed paths

### Frontend Level

- Virtual scrolling considerations
- Lazy loading of tree branches
- Debouncing scroll events

## Testing and Edge Cases

### Common Pitfalls

- Circular references and data validation
- Handling orphaned nodes
- Deep nesting performance limits

### Testing Strategies

- Unit testing tree traversal logic
- Integration testing with Livewire
- Load testing with large datasets

## Alternative Approaches

### Materialized Path Pattern

- When to consider path-based hierarchies
- Trade-offs compared to adjacency list model
- Implementation differences

### Nested Set Model

- Benefits for read-heavy workloads
- Complexity of maintaining left/right values
- When it might be more appropriate

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

- Summary of implementation challenges solved
- Performance considerations learned
- When this approach is most suitable

### Future Improvements

- Potential enhancements to the solution
- Scalability considerations
- Integration with other Laravel features
